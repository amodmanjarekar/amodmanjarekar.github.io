	<p class="question">What are the different types of exercises that I can focus on?</p>
	<p class="answer">Research has shown that it’s important to get four different types of exercise:</p>
		<ol class="subtitle">
			<li>Endurance </li>
			<li>Strength </li>
			<li>Balance </li>
			<li>Flexibility </li>
		</ol>
	<p class="answer">Each one has different benefits. Doing one kind also can improve your ability to do the others, and variety helps reduce boredom and risk of injury.</p>

	<p class="question">5 best exercises you should pick up</p>
	<p class="answer">According to Harvard, there are certain workouts that blitz all the others when it comes to effectiveness. A new health report released by Harvard Medical School suggests ditching running for these five other workouts that have less impact on your joints and digestive system:</p>

	<h2 class="subtitle">Swimming</h2>
	<center><img src="images/swimming.jpg" width="50%"></center>
	<p class="answer">You might call swimming the best workout. The buoyancy of the water supports your body and takes the strain off painful joints so you can move them more fluidly. "Swimming is good for individuals with arthritis because it's less weight-bearing," explains Dr. I-Min Lee, professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. Research has found that swimming can also improve your mental state and put you in a better mood. Water aerobics is another option. These classes help you burn calories and tone up.</p><br><br>

	<h2 class="subtitle">Tai Chi</h2>
	<center><img src="images/taichi.jpg" width="50%"></center>
	<p class="answer">This Chinese martial art that combines movement and relaxation is good for both body and mind. In fact, it's been called "meditation in motion." Tai chi is made up of a series of graceful movements, one transitioning smoothly into the next. Because the classes are offered at various levels, tai chi is accessible — and valuable — for people of all ages and fitness levels. "It's particularly good for older people because balance is an important component of fitness, and balance is something we lose as we get older," Dr. Lee says. Take a class to help you get started and learn the proper form. You can find tai chi programs at your local health club, community center, or senior center.</p>

	<h2 class="subtitle">Strength Training</h2>
	<center><img src="images/bodybuilder.jpg" width="50%"></center>
	<p class="answer">If you believe that strength training is a macho, brawny activity, think again. Lifting light weights won't bulk up your muscles, but it will keep them strong. "If you don't use muscles, they will lose their strength over time," Dr. Lee says. Muscle also helps burn calories. "The more muscle you have, the more calories you burn, so it's easier to maintain your weight," says Dr. Lee. Similar to other exercise, strength training may also help preserve brain function in later years. Before starting a weight training program, be sure to learn the proper form. Start light, with just one or two pounds. You should be able to lift the weights 10 times with ease. After a couple of weeks, increase that by a pound or two. If you can easily lift the weights through the entire range of motion more than 12 times, move up to slightly heavier weight.</p>

	<h2 class="subtitle">Walking</h2>
	<center><img src="images/walking.jpg" width="50%"></center>
	<p class="answer">Walking is simple, yet powerful. It can help you stay trim, improve cholesterol levels, strengthen bones, keep blood pressure in check, lift your mood, and lower your risk for a number of diseases (diabetes and heart disease, for example). A number of studies have shown that walking and other physical activities can even improve memory and resist age-related memory loss. All you need is a well-fitting and supportive pair of shoes. Start with walking for about 10 to15 minutes at a time. Over time, you can start to walk farther and faster, until you're walking for 30 to 60 minutes on most days of the week.</p>

	<p class="question">Closing Lines</p>
	<p class="answer">Many of the things we do for fun (and work) count as exercise. Raking the yard counts as physical activity. So does ballroom dancing and playing with your kids or grandkids. As long as you're doing some form of aerobic exercise for at least 30 minutes a day, and you include two days of strength training a week, you can consider yourself an "active" person.</p>
